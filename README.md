Modelling and Simulation Projects

# Project 1
Simulation of a biomedical system for treating a cancerous tumor with chemotherapy, including a pharmacokinetic model, a pharmacodynamic model, and a tumor growth model.

# Project 2
Simulation of a discrete Markov stochastic system using the Monte Carlo method.

# Project 3
Simulation of a hybrid dynamic system, i.e. one in which the system is made up of continuous states and discrete states. This study is carried out by simulating a ball, assuming that it is a material point that moves due to the force of gravity.
